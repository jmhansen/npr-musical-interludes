# Public Radio Interludes Project

I'm a frequent NPR listener, and over the years I've discovered a lot of good music by paying attention to the 
musical interludes between NPR stories.  This is a personal project using 
[Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#) to compile song data from npr.org and the 
Spotify API for serving images and song clips.

View the project at [https://public-radio-interludes.herokuapp.com](https://public-radio-interludes.herokuapp.com).

Currently the project has interlude data for four programs:
* All Things Considered
* Morning Edition
* Weekend Edition Saturday
* Weekend Edition Sunday

The database includes:
* ~90,000 interludes, representing over 14,000 artists and 40,000 songs
* ~6,000 episodes, dating from October, 2000
